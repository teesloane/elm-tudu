> Half Finished clone of [teux deux] with elm and clojure.

This was built to play around with Elm. I got a prototype working, but grew a
little dis-interested, and also found my Elm code getting progressively harder
to read and reason about. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Tossing this up in case it might be useful for those getting into Elm.

**Development:**

You'll need Elm and Clojure installed... and then follow the messy make file
commands...
