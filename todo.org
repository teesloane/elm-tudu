* Notes
** Comparable Dict.fromList 
interesting: https://github.com/elm/compiler/issues/774
  - ran into this  when trying to map over a list of DAYs but it wouldn't let me
    do a Dict.fromList because Day wasn't comparable.

    We've run into this a lot with validation errors.

Specifically we want to enumerate all the fields on a form as a union type (e.g. type Field = Username | Password | Email), and then to represent validation errors as a Dict Field String so we can easily look up whether there is an error on a given field with things like Dict.get.

We work around this by using List (Field, String) as a fake Dict and then filter it a lot. You can see a public example of where we're doing this here: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-rails/1.1.0/Rails-Decode - we'd definitely prefer if that function had the following signature:

errors : Dict String comparable -> Decoder (Dict comparable (List String))
Right now we can't do that, because if we did we couldn't use union types for our fields.
