#+TITLE: todo

A todolist in here? Ironic.

* [ ] Build week view. Display 7 days at a time.


* Ability to render a week
- get the current day,
- get 4 or 5 days after that and one day before
  - possibly just adding or subtracting date->millis and figuring out hard coded
    for 24 hours.
- for each day, iterate over the todolist and if the todo date falls inside the
  todo, put it in a ul underneath the date.
